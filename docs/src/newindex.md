# JuliaOptimizationChallenge


## Algorithm

The algorithm we used is...

## Upper Bound

We computed our upper bound by... We know that it must be an upper bound because...
<!-- Essentially added the fastest streets until the total sum of the durations is greater than the total_duration times the number of cars-->

## Efficiency

Some choiced we made to improve efficiency were...
