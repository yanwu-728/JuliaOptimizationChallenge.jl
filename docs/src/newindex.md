## Algorithm

The algorithm we used is...

## Upper Bound

We computed our upper bound by... We know that it must be an upper bound because...
<!-- # Justify a proof for this that you include in documentation
    # Idea: Calculate the total duration and distance of all of the streets. If total duration>allowed*nb_cars, remove duration 
    # and distance from the slowest streets (i.e. smalles distance/time) -->

## Efficiency

Some choiced we made to improve efficiency were...
