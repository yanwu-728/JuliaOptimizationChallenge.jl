Assume for contradiction that OPT differs from our solution in portion of at least one street. In this case, there is some fraction of some street, s* , that is in OPT that was not included in our upper bound algorithm. Since we include streets in order of decreasing speed, s* must be no faster than any street we included in the upper bound. Let the chunk of s* that we don't include have distance d* and duration t* . Notice that for any chunk of t* time, the streets that are included in our upper bound will all have contributed a distance of at least d* because they were all at least as fast as s* . Therefore, if we replace any chunk of duration t* in our upper bound with a chunk from s* of equal duration, the total distance covered will either stay the same or decrease. Notice that if the distance stays the same, then we can repeat this process until our upper bound was transformed into OPT with the total distance. This would imply that our upper bound was optimal to begin with. Otherwise, if the distance decreases when we swap in s* , this would imply that OPT was not optimal because our upper bound was better which is a contradiction. Since our assumption was that OPT differs from our upper bound, this contradiction would imply that OPT is the same as our upper bound. Therefore, there must exist no way to pick streets such that the sum of the durations is at most total_duration and sum of the distance is larger than our upper bound.","category":"page"},{"location":"newindex/#Efficiency","page":"Explanation","title":"Efficiency","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"newindex/#Solver-Algorithm-2","page":"Explanation","title":"Solver Algorithm","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"newindex/","page":"Explanation","title":"Explanation","text":"Some choiced we made to improve efficiency were...","category":"page"},{"location":"newindex/#Upper-Bound-2","page":"Explanation","title":"Upper Bound","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"newindex/","page":"Explanation","title":"Explanation","text":"used sort! to sort in place instead of creating a new vector","category":"page"}]
